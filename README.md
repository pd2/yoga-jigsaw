Yoga Jigsaw puzzle

Yoga, the ancient Indian discipline for physical exercise, has many benefits to the body and even one's mind. In this day and age with bulging waistline and sedentary lifestyle, Yoga assumes even more importance for our health and wellbeing.

In my attempt to create more interest in Yoga among the newer generation, I created a web app that presents a jigsaw puzzle made out of a yoga pose. 

In this game, the image of an Aasana is cut up into 12 tiles and presented on a grid in a random order. The player needs to swap the tiles into the correct order to solve the puzzle. A clue in the form of the equivalent English name of the pose is also shown. Upon solving the jigsaw, the player is presented with details of that particular Aasana like level of yogi / yogini to practise this, and few benefits of doing the Aasana.
